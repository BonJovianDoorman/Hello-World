# Hello-World

I am a High School student and I program for team 4053 in the FIRST competitions. Each year the challenge chages and so does the libraries of the code. We have used labview up until the beginning of the school fall semester in 2015. Now we are using Java to program the robot. Since we are so new we do not use most of the classes and functions it wants you to but it still works fine. I will post my code for people and teams having trouble with this because it took us a while to figure it out.
